# URN Toggle

## What it Does

### Problem

- CTS- and CITE2-URNs are long; they are awkward when scattered throughout a dataset.
- At the same time, CTS- and CITE2-URNs are the only complete and unambiguous way to identify scholarly data in the CITE-Architecture.

### Solution

The URN-Toggle widget offers the best of all possible worlds, by allowing CTS- and CITE2-URNs to be displayed in four different states:

- "`urn`": The shortest state. Indicates that there is a URN attached to some data.
- "`…:tlg0012.tlg001.msA:1.1`" or "`…:msA.2019a:12r`": Group/Work/Version:Passage (for CTS-URNs) or Collections/Version:Selector (for CITE2-URNs). The human-parsable content necessary for identification by a human reader.
- "`1.1`" or "`12r`": The passage-component only (for CTS-URNs), or the object-selector only (for CITE2-URNs).
- The full URN.
